            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>Neither have I heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it fit I should, it was never well in this Kingdom, as Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> observed, since publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates were made the subject of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate discourses; but the wisdome of this Government hath better provided that none of the great Consultations of that most August and solemn Assembly in the World, should be published without Their leave.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>D. L.</speaker>
               <p>Very fit it is that people should study to be quiet, and follow their own business; the neglect of this last makes men <hi>Idle,</hi> and the times bad; that of the first makes them turbulent, and the times dangerous.

               <p>Why that is itâ€”there cannot a Vote pass at <hi>Westminster</hi> for the removing of the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Trade, but it is cryed at <hi>London</hi> a <hi>Dutch Warre:</hi> with so little judgement do we discourse

               <speaker>R. R.</speaker>
               <p>It was Voted by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Patriots that ever sat within those Walls, <q>That all obstructions of Trade should be removed; and particularly that the injuries and affronts done us by the <hi>Dutch</hi> should be enquired into and remedied by all meanes possible, and that they would stand by his most Excellent Majesty in this enquiry and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with their Lives and Fortunes.</q>

               <p>That you must excuseme
<pb facs="tcp:40895:8"/> in, it being as much as every man can do to give a reason of his own actions: this is visible, Trade is decayed; and there is not a Prince more knowing in the Concernes, nor more tender of the interest of Trade in the Christian world then our Dread Soveraign.</p>

Their ambition is solid for realities rather then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations to serve the publick State rather then private humours; much better is it (say they) to be <hi>port of Holland in possession then Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor King of Jerusalem:</hi> 6.

Usury is a stranger amongst them, every man laying out his estate upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Traffick: 8. No Idleness there and so no Thieves, which is more restrained there by Whipping, then here by Hanging: 9. If any man gaines extraordinary by money, the tenth of his gain is the Common-wealths; Usurers escaping not there as here, scot-free: 10. A man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by Casualty, they set up again; a man cast into Prison the Creditor must maintain; A man troubled with a shifting Adversary, a quick
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40895:35"/> tryal relieves: 10. Add to this the blessing of God, which they implore before any consultation upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary State matters, upon their <hi>Bid-dayes</hi> as they call them: 11. All men debate, and all contribute to the publick Affaires as concerned both by advice and purse: 12. Their Resolutions are secret and sudden: 13.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> are usually of large Statures, handsome and fair Aspects, stronge and able bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, their minds are not less vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then their bodies; their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is resolute, their spirit undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their nature open and pleasant, their callings beneficial and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; their Genious apt to all Arts, especially the Mechanical and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: their Ambition is their liberty and privilege, which they have maintained this hundred years with much blood and treasure: their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses frngal, to the saving of an Egge-shell, they maintaining it for a maxime that a thing lasts longer mended then new: their respects
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40895:38"/> and considerations are narrow and restrained; their way is active &amp; stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and Provision is made for their necessitous people, but none for the idle, who must work there or they shall not eat; the time they spend is in eating well, and drinking much, and prating most: <q>The truth is (saith my ingenious Author) the compleatest Drinker in <hi>Europe</hi> is your <hi>English</hi> Gallant, there is no such consumer of Liquor as the quaffing of his Healths; the <hi>Dutch</hi> were good at it, but now they have got a custome of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over their pots, they sip, and laugh, and tell their tale; and in a Tavern are more prodigal of their time then of their Wine, they drink as if they were short winded, and as it were eat their drink by morsells and let it down by piece meals, rather besieging then assaulting their braines; in a word we are Drinkers, they are soakers; an <hi>English</hi> man is sooner, a <hi>Dutch</hi> man longer drunk.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:40895:39"/>
                  <p> Their recreation is warlike, and they are taught to be Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have attained to be men; Nay (saith my ingenious and noble friend) as if they placed a Religion in Armes, every Sunday is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Train-bands marching through the City.</p>
                  <p>They are rather cunning then wise, crafty then cunning, and close then either; their Commonwealth being managed rather by the subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Trads men, then the policy of States men: their Intelligence is as spreading as their Traffick, and their Traffick as large as the World; there being no Nation under heaven to the bottom of whose Counsels, Interests and concernes they have not insinuated themselves.</p>
                  <p>Their Religion sits loose to them and is their profession rather then their practise, wherein they are too noble a people to be hypocrites, and too civil to be profane, and so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to observe a mean not proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boasting their Religion as their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40895:39"/> shew, but humbly owning it as their duty; they are Jewes of the New Testament, that have changed onely the Law for the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Their Language though it differ from the higher <hi>Germany,</hi> yet hath it the same ground, and is as old as <hi>Babel,</hi> &amp; although harsh yet of so lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty signification &amp; so full a tongue, as made <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> maintain it for the speech of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise; <hi>Steven</hi> of <hi>Bruges</hi> reckoneth up 2170 Monosillables which being expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, richly grace that tongue; a Tongue as large as <hi>Europe,</hi> spoken in <hi>Germany, Denmarke, Norway, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> (for most of our old words are <hi>Dutch,</hi>) and so little altered that it is in a manner the same it was 2000. years ago, without the too much mingled bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowings of their Neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Every thing about them is neat but themselves, the first thing in their houses is a Looking-glass, wherein sure the Landlord seldome
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40895:40"/> sees his face: their Vessels are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalled so orderly as if they were rather for shew then use, ornaments rather then utensils; the <hi>Dutch</hi> mans Building is not large, but neat; handsome on the outside, on the inside hung with Pictures, not Tapistry, he that hath not bread to eat hath a Picture; <q>Were the knackes of all their Houses set to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there would not be such another <hi>Bartholomew-</hi>Fair in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
                     </q> the <hi>Hogen</hi> paints well yet he ever writes under his sign what it is: His Chambers are but several sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boxes, and there you must either go out to spit, or blush when you see the Map brought.</p>
                  <p>Their Beds are no other but land Cabines, high enough to need a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or staires, up once, you are walled in with Wainscot, and that is (saith my Friend) good discretion to avoid the trouble of making your Will every night, for once falling out else you would break your neck perfectly; But if you die in it, this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40895:40"/> comfore you will leave your friends that you died in clean Linnen. Their Habitations are kept handsomer then their bodies, and their bodies then their soules: at first sight you find the And-Irons shut up in Net work, next you have the Warming-pan maffled in <hi>Italian</hi> work, next that the Sconce clad in Cambrick, and like a Crown advanced in the midle of the house.</p>

                  <p>1. Clownish and blunt to men, respecting neither person, nor Apparel; they gaze at, and envy, but never reverence a Gentlemen.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>2. Chast and modest to their Women, being strangers to the two fomentors of Lust, idleness and Courtship; alwayes doing less then they speak, and speaking less then they think.</p>

                  <p>1. They are seldome decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for they will trust no body; 2. They may alwayes deceive, for you must trust them as for instances if you travel to ask a bill of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars is to purre in a Wasps Nests; you must pay what they ask as sure as if it were the assessement of a Subsidy; 3. Complement is an idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, those busie people were never skilled in: they are half Marred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saylors; &amp; being Souldiers they are quite spoiled, for then they would let a <hi>Jew</hi> build a City where <hi>Harlem-mere</hi> is and after cousen them of it; 4. They shall abuse a stranger for nothing, and after a few
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40895:42"/> base termes scortch one another to a <hi>Carbonado,</hi> or as they do their Roches when they fry them; 5.

                  <p>Their Cookery is natural, and an artificial dressing of Meat you can perswade them to neither with love or money; you must have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience at their Tables to stay till break of day, to pledge every man about you, and to sit with a woman of each side of you, carrying away in the morning it may be instead of Sweet-meates a piece of Apple-Pie in your pocket.</p>

                  <p>I Pray will you make out what Right we have to the Narrow Seas in few words.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>I. S.</speaker>
                  <p>1. The Seas that surrounds our Island, whether the <hi>Scottish,</hi> the <hi>Brittish,</hi> the <hi>Irish,</hi> or <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> were possessed, and secured by the <hi>Brittains,</hi> who fished so much upon them that they burnished the Hilts of their Swords with such Fishes Teeth as they took; and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so considerably that none came amongst them but Merchant.</p>
                  <p>2. Those Seas were by them transmitted with their Countries to the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the Conquest, who as they managed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Land by Presidents, so they did that at Sea by an <hi>Archigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernasy,</hi> or chief Governour and Admiral; who secured Commerce, took prizes, looked on the Coasts
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40895:44"/> of <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Affrica</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>3. After the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> succeeded to this Right and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and commanded the Sea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Count of the <hi>Saxon</hi> shore, <hi>i. e.</hi> (whatever <hi>Panarollus</hi> saith to the contrary) the Sea-shore, <hi>Octa</hi> and <hi>Ebista</hi> under <hi>Vortigerne</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist</hi> commanding these Seas, the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> keeping a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Navy to that purpose, by such tributes and duties as they imposed upon their Vassals particularly <hi>Dane-gelt</hi> for the Guard of the Sea; <hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>Canutus</hi> stiling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Soveraign of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>4. The Right and Dominion of the Seas passed with this Nation to the <hi>Normans,</hi> as appears 1. From their government, the custody of the <hi>seas</hi> alwaies being under an <hi>admiral</hi> by Commissions from the several Kings maintained by tributes, paid in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the said Custody; 2. From their right in all the Isalnds lying on the Sea before the <hi>French</hi> shore; 3. From leave asked alwaies
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40895:44"/> and granted by Forreigners of the <hi>English</hi> to pass those seas.</p>

                  <p>The Kings of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> the Hans-Towns in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time; the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> themselves not daring to Fish before they asked leave of <hi>Scarborough;</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> proclaiming <hi>May</hi> 6. 1610. that none Fish upon the <hi>English</hi> or the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea without leave obtained at every year at least renewed, from the Commissioners appointed for this purpose at <hi>London.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>7. From the Laws and most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Customs of <hi>England that make the Seas</hi> the patrimony of <hi>England; and the King of the old Custome of England, Lord of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas;</hi> and his Soveraignty there so ancient; they make the four Seas to be equivalent with those words within or without the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <hi>De mer appurtenant au Roy l'Angleterre:</hi> the Sea belonging to the King of <hi>England.</hi>

And each of these employ another Vessel for providing of Salt, and transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Fish, making in all 1600. Ships, which maintaines and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy persons of all sorts, 4000. at least.</p>
                  <p>For the Herring season they have 1600. Busses at the least, all of them Fishing onely upon our coasts, from <hi>Boughonness</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> to the mouth of <hi>Thames.</hi>

Fishers and Marriners. All which maintaine double, if not treble, so many Tradesmen, Women and Children a land.</p>
                  <p>Moreover they have 400. other Vessels at least, that take Herring at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and there sell them for ready money: so that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> (besides 300.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40895:50"/> the number of their Shipping to at least 10000. Saile, being more then are in <hi>England, France, Spain, Portngal, Italy, Denmarke, Poland, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Russia.</hi> And to this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they add every day, although their Country it self, affords them neither Materials, nor Victuals, nor Merchandize to be accounted of towards their setting forth. Besides these of <hi>Holland, Lubeck,</hi> have 700. great Ships, <hi>Hamborough</hi> 600. <hi>Emb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> 400. whereunto the Ships of <hi>Bremern, Biscay, portugal, Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which for the most part Fish in our Seas; and it will appear that 10000. Saile for forreign Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and above are imployed and maintained by Fishing upon our Coasts. So that in <hi>Holland</hi> there are built 1000 Saile at the least, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply shipwracks, and augment their store; which as the prime and common Nursery, is the chiefest means onely to encrease their number.</p>

                  <p>By reason of these multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Ships and Marriners they have extended their Trade to all parts of the World, exporting for the most part in all their Voyages our Herring, and other Fish for the maintenance of the same; in exchange whereof they return the several
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40895:51"/> Commodities of other Countries.</p>
                  <p>From the southern parts, as <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> for our Herrings they return Oyles, Wines, Pruines, Honey, Wooles, &amp;c. and with store of Coine in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Straights,</hi> Velvets, Sattins, and all sorts of Silkes, Allames, Currans, Oyles, and all Grocery Ware, with much money.</p>
                  <p>From the East Countries for our Herrings, and other <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Commodities before retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they bring Home, Corne, Wax, Flax, Hemp, Pitch, Tarre, Sope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ashes, Iron, Copper, Steel, Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, Wainscot, Timber, Deale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, Dollers, and <hi>Hungary</hi> Gilders.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Germany</hi> for Herrings, and other salt Fish, Iron, Steel, Glass, Milstones, Rhenish Wines, Button<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate for Armour, with other Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, Silkes, Velvets, Rashes, Fustians, Baratees, and such like <hi>Frankeford</hi> Commodities, with store of <hi>Rix-Dollers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Brabant</hi> they return for
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40895:51"/> the most part ready money with some Tapistryes, and Hullship; yea some of our Herring are carried as far as <hi>Brasile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that which is more strange and greatly to our shame, they have 4 hundred Ships with Fish, in which our men of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> within <hi>Ken,</hi> almost at Land do vent our Herrings amongst us here in <hi>England,</hi> and make us pay for the Fish taken upon our own Coast ready money, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they store their own Country.</p>

                  <p>By this their large extent of Trade they are became as it were Citizens of the whole World, whereby they have so enlarged their Townes, that most of them within 400. years that are full as great again as they were before; <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Leyden,</hi> and <hi>Midleburgh,</hi> having been lately twice enlarged, and their Streets, and buildings so fair, and orderly set forth, that for beauty
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40895:52"/> and strength they may compare with any other in the World, upon which they bestow infinite summes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; all originally flowing from the bounty of the Sea, from whence by their labour and industry they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the beginning of all that Wealth and greatness; and particularly for the Havens of the aforesaid Townes, whereof some of them cast 40. 50. or 100000<hi>l.</hi> Their Fortifications also both for number and strength, upon which they have bestowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite summes of money, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with any other whatsoever.</p>

                  <p>Such being then the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Ships and Marriners, and so great their Trade, occasioned principally by their Fishing; they have not onely strengthened and fortified themselves at home, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell all forreign invasions, as lately in the Warr between them and <hi>Spain,</hi> but have likewise stretched
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40895:52"/> their power into the East, and West-<hi>Indies</hi> in many places, whereof they are Lords of the Sea Coasts, and have likewise Fortified upon the Maine, where the Kings and people are at their Devotion. And more then this, all neighbouring Princes in their differences (by reason of this their power at Sea,) are glad to have them of their party: so that next to the <hi>English</hi> they are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the most redoubted Nation at Sea of any other whatsoever.</p>

                  <speaker>I. B.</speaker>
                  <p>That may appear in that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty years since, over and above the Customs of other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, Excises, Licenses, Waftage and Lastage, there was payed to the State for custome of Herring and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther salt Fish above 300000. pound in one year, besides the tenth Fish, and Cask payed for Waftage, which cometh at the least to as much more among the <hi>Hollanders</hi> onely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40895:53"/> the tenth of other Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added it amounteth to a far greater summe.</p>
                  <p>We are likewise to know that great part of their Fish is sold in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries for ready money, for which they commonly export of the finest Gold and Silver, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home recoine it of a baser allay under their own stampe, which is not a small means to augment their publick treasure.</p>

                  <p>That will appear to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great by these following particulars:</p>
                  <p>During the Warrs between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> before the last Truce, <hi>Dunkirke</hi> by taking, spoiling, and burning the Busses of <hi>Holland,</hi> and setting great ransome upon their Fishermen, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced them to compound for great summs that they might Fish quietly for one year, whereupon the next
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40895:53"/> year after the Fishermen agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves to pay a Doller upon every Last of Herrins, towards the maintenance of certain Ships of Warr to waft and secure them in their Fishing, by reason whereof there was a Record kept of the several Lasts of Herrins taken that year, and it appeared thereby that in one halfe a year there were taken 30000. Lasts of Herrins which at 16. 20. 30. pound <hi>per</hi> Last a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth to 3600000 and at 16. 20. 30. pound the Last they ordinarily sold, then transported into other Countries, it cometh at least to 5000000 <hi>l.</hi> whereunto if we add the Herrings taken by other Nations, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Cod, Ling, Hake, and the Fish taken by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and other our Neighbours upon the <hi>Brittish</hi> Coasts all the year long, the total will evidently arise to be above 1000000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great trade of Fishing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying so many men at Sea must necessarily maintaine as great a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40895:54"/> number of Trades men and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers by Land, as Spinners, Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winders to make Cables, Cordage, Yarne twine for Nets, Weavers to make Saile Cloaths, Cecive Pachers, Tollers Dressers, and Couchers to sort and make the Herring lawful Merchandize; Tanners to Tan their Sailes and Nets; and Coopers to make Caskes, Block and Bowl ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers for Shipes; Keelemen and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers for carrying and removing their Fish; Sawyers for plantiers, Carpenters, Shipwrights, Smiths, Carmen, Boatmen, Brewers, Bakers, and others that cannot otherwise live with their Wives, Children and Families; every Orphan, Servant, or poor man may venture their stock in Fishing Voyages, which affords them extraordinary encrease, and is duly paid according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their gain.</p>

                  <p>Though there be nothing in <hi>Holland</hi> but Hops, Madder, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40895:54"/> and Cheese; yet by fishing they have plentiful of all manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for necessity, as Corne, Beef, Mutton, Hides, Cloathes; for luxury as Wines, Silkes, Spices, or defence as Pitch, Tarre, Cordage, Timber; all which they have not onely in competent proportion for their use, but are likewise able from their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Magazines to supply their Neighbour Country.</p>

                  <p>Might we not thrive as well as they upon our own Fish?</p>

                  <speaker>J. B.</speaker>
                  <p>We might no doubt, and have those Fish for nothing that we pay them for, repairing thereby 230. small Fisher Towns decayed for want of that improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and adding both honour, strength, and riches to our King and Country, which how easily it may be done will appear by some few Observations following.</p>
                  <p>By erecting two hundred and fifty Busses of reasonable strength and bigness there will be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made for 1000. Ships, and for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40895:55"/> at least 10000. Fishermen and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners at Sea, and consequently for as many Tradesmen, and Labourers at Land.</p>
                  <p>The Herrings taken by the Busses will afford his Majesty 200000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly custome outward; and for Commodities returned inward 30000 <hi>l.</hi> and above.</p>
                  <p>We have Timber sufficient, and at reasonable rates growing in our own Kingdome for the building of Busses, every Shire affordeth har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and able men fit for such imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who now live poorly, and idle at home.</p>
                  <p>We have Victuals in great plenty sold at easie rates, without payment of Excises, or impost.</p>
                  <p>Our Shores and Harbours are near the places where the Fish do haunt.</p>
                  <p>For Drink, or Nets, salting and packing our fish, and for succour in stress of Weather, we may bring our Fish to Land, salt and pack it, and from some parts of his Majesties
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40895:55"/> Dominions be at our Markets in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> before the <hi>Hollander</hi> can arrive in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have meanes to transport our Fish into some Northern Countries where the <hi>Hollander</hi> seldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come. And though we had as many Busses as the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> yet is their vent for all, or more, for in East and Northern Countries where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> seldome or never come. And though we had as many Busses as the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> yet is there vent for all, or more, for in the East and Northern Countries and in many other places, Herrins are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry daies meat, winter and summer, as well to draw on drink as to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie hunger; and in most places the greatest part of the year they be scarce to be had; for presently after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> the <hi>Sound</hi> and Rivers are frozen up, so as no Herrings can be transported into twenty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and free States untill <hi>July,</hi> which is for thirty weeks space to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, so that when Lent comes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40895:56"/> there are few to be bought for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Lastly, since by care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry we gained cloathing from the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> doubtless so by the same meanes we may as easily grow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the art of Fishing, and in time make it a staple Commodity of our own.</p>

                  <p>What are the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that hinder our improvement of our Fishing?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>J. B.</speaker>
                  <p>1. General liberty of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flesh, contrary to old custome, and the statute Laws provided for observing Fish dayes, from whence our scarcity and dearth of fish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth; for where Flesh is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily spent fish will not be bought, and want of sale decayeth all trade, Gaine being the nurse of Industry.</p>
                  <p>2. Want of order and discretion in our fishing, every man being left to himself, and permited to fish as best liketh him; whereas amongst the <hi>Hollanders</hi> two of the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Fishermen are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to guide the rest of the Fleet,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40895:56"/> all others being bound to follow them, and to cast their Lines accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their direction.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions set forth with their Busses in <hi>June</hi> to find the Shoale of fish, and having found it, dwell amongst it till <hi>November,</hi> whereas we stay till the Herring come home to our road steads, and sometimes suffer them to pass by ere we look out, our Herring-fishing containing onely seven weekes at the most, and theirs twenty.</p>
                  <p>4. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> Busses are great and strong, and able to brook foul weather, whereas our Cables, Cracsers and Boates being small, and thin sided, are easily swallowed by a rough Sea, not daring to adventure far in fair weather, by reason of their weakness for fear of stormes.</p>
                  <p>5. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and no sooner are discharged of loading, but presently put forth for more, and seek for Markets abroad as well as at home; whereas our
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40895:57"/>
                     <hi>English</hi> after they had been once at Sea, do commonly never return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain untill all the money taken for their Fish be spent, and they in debt seeking onely to serve the next Market.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have certain Merchants who during the Herring season do onely come to the places where the Busses arrive, and joyning together in several companies, do presently agree for the lading of 30. or 40. Busses at once, and so being discharged t<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ey may speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to then former Shipping; whereas our Fishermen are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their Chapmen, and forced to spend much time in putting off their Fish by parcells.</p>

                  <p>It was enacted 33. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Because the <hi>English</hi> Fishermen dwelling on the Sea Coasts did leave off their trade of Fishing in our Seas, and went the halfe Seas over, and there upon the Seas did buy fish
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40895:57"/> of <hi>Pickards, Flemmings, Normans, Zealanders;</hi> by reason whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny incommodities did grow to the Realme, <hi>viz.</hi> The decay of the wealth and prosperity as well of the Cinque Ports, and Members of the same as of other Coast Towns by the Sea side, which were builded, and inhabited by great multitudes of people, by reason of using and exercising the craft and feat of fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Secondly, the decay of a great number of Boates and Ships. And thirdly, the decay of many good Marriners, both able in body by their diligence, labour, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual exercise of fishing, and expert by reason thereof in the knowledge of the Sea Coasts, as well within this Realme as in other parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas. It was therefore enacted that no manner of persons, <hi>English,</hi> Denizens, or strangers at that time, or any time after dwelling in <hi>England,</hi> should buy any Fish of any Strangers in the said Ports of <hi>Flanders, Zealand, Picardy, France,</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:40895:58"/> or upon the Sea between shore and shore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>It will be a wonderfull thing to see what a mighty subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of Wealth, and a huge Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable power that State is come to, by a rare unparalleld industry; For I dare avouch that the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth, (though she had her head as well knit in her Infancy as any that ever was) did not come near her, in so short a progress of time, to such a growth of strength.</p>
                  <p>But it seemes all things conspired to raise <hi>Holland</hi> to this pass: First, the humour of the people, being patient and industrious, and of a genious more inclinable to a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Government then to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40895:58"/> Add hereunto the quality of the Country, being every where halfe cut, and as it were inlayed with water, and thereby much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and made in many places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible; so that if need were, <hi>Holland</hi> could turn her self into a huge pond when she list.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto concurred a further advantage of scituation, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords her all kind of Materials for Shipping, and for all kind of Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Military Forces, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> both swarming with superfluous people, suspectfull of the <hi>Spainish</hi> greatness, and so not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to contribute Auxiliary strength for mutual security and conservation.</p>
                  <p>Navigation and Mercautile Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, are two Poles whereon the State doth move, and to both these it seemes Nature her self hath expresly de<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>igned both Country and People; them by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary kind of propensity, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40895:59"/> by apt position, for having no land to manure it, they plow the very bowels of the deep, the wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forehead of <hi>Neptune</hi> being the furrowes that yields them encrease.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, there being great Rivers that slice and cut the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try up and down to disgorge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the Ocean, those Rivers may be said to pay them tribute, as well as to the Sea; which Rivers branching themselves into large and bearing streams, did so fitly serve one another, and all the whole, that it may be said, Nature in the frame of humane bodies did not discover more art in distributing the veines and arteries, for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily conveyance of the mass of blood into each part, as she hath shewed here in dispersing those waters so orderly for Traffick.</p>
                  <p>These Rivers bring her what the large content of <hi>Germany,</hi> and other Eastern Countries afford, and she lying between them and the Sea, furnisheth them with all far fetched
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40895:59"/>

                  <p>Here you shall see the most indust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious people upon earth making a rare virtue of necessity, for the same thing which makes a Parret speak, makes them to labour; For having nothing of their own, yet they bound with all things, and may be said, to live by the idleness of some of Neighbours, I am loath to name here who they are.</p>
                  <p>Here you shall find a people grow rich also by that which useth to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish others, even by Warrs, for prizes and booties abroad, go to make a good part of their wealth.</p>
                  <p>Yet in conversation they are but heavy, of a homely outside, and slow in action, which slowness carrieth with it a notable perseverence, and this may be imputed to the quality of that mould of earth, whereon they dwell, which may be said to be a kind of standing pool of Aire: and which is known to have such a force of assimilation, that when
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40895:60"/> people of a more vivacious temper come to mingle with them at the second Generation, they seem to participate of the soile and aire, and degenerate into meer <hi>Hollanders;</hi> the like is found daily in Horses and Dogs, and all other Animals.</p>

                  <p>They raise one year with the other for the common charge of the Union, (besides the extraordinary Impositions that rise and fall with their occasions) 3200000. Crownes, <hi>i. e.</hi> 800000. upon the particular Provinces, <hi>Holland</hi> contributing half, <hi>Zealand</hi> a fifth part, and <hi>Friezland</hi> about a tenth.</p>

                  <p>1. Their Traffick makes good what is wanting in their Land, the commodiousness for the Sea, the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40895:61"/> narrowness of their ground, and the industry of the Inhabitants, the defects of nature.</p>
                  <p>2. But the people bear it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently because their liberty could not long endure without Armes, nor Armes without stipends, nor their stipends without impositions, and the united Provinces will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies so apprehend the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> or their other enemies, as they will easily be perswaded, to be alwaies prepared for Warr that so they may the easier evade all new hazards.</p>
                  <p>3. They put forty dayes in the Souldiers moneth for pay, and so save a great deal of money, and pay exactly which prevents a great deal of disorder incident to more needy Armies.</p>
                  <p>4. They raise the money to maintain the Banks and Channels of each Province, and out of their Treasuries advance a publick Stock.</p>

                  <p>As they equal all <hi>Europe</hi> in Trade, so they exceed it in the number of their Ships; which people as it were the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas, especially before <hi>Amsterdam</hi> that hath engrossed the Western trade of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and that Eastern of <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and is the staple as <hi>Rotterdam</hi> is the Arsenal of that Country which is entrenched with the Sea, and <hi>Bull</hi> worked with Ships: they have no Timber growing, yet they sell Timber to most Nations, besides what they use themselves: they are dull by Land, but water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devils at Sea, being all Seamen born, and bred either in Merchandizing, or Sea-faring, and like Frogs can live both of Land and Water; not a Country <hi>Æ²riester</hi> or Waterman but can handle an Oare, steer a Boat, raise a Mast, and bear you out in the roughest streights you come at; Sailers among them are as common as Beggers among us: they can drink, raile, swear, nigle, streat and be lowsy alike; but a mess of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40895:62"/> their Knaves is worth a million of ours, for they in a boisterous rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness can work, live and toile; <q>Whereas ours will rather laze themselves to poverty, and like Cabbages left out in Winter rot away in the loathsomeless of a nauseous sloath; in Fleets they can fight close and rather hazard all then save some while others perish, but single they will slag and fear like Birds in a Bush, when the Sparrow-hawks bills are heard.</q> Their Fisher Boates pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for the Ships, and fishing fits them for fighting.</p>

                  <p>But that which compleats their strength and power at Sea is their skill in Navigation, not a Climate Star or wind but they understand, not a Sea but their youth are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to, nor a streight or passage but they are shewed: so that they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross the <hi>Indies, Basile,</hi> the <hi>Portugal,</hi> cousen the <hi>Spaniard</hi> abuse the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> and carry all at Sea before them; <q>Onely a <hi>Turkish</hi> man of Warr is as dreadful to them as a Falcon to a Mallord, against whom their best remedies is to steal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</q>

                  <speaker>L. M.</speaker>
                  <p>Good Sir, the manner of their Government?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T. O.</speaker>
                  <p>For the manner of their Government, they have upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion an Assembly of the General States, like our Parliament, being composed of those which are sent from every Province upon sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and what these enact, stands for Law; then is there besides a Councel of State, residing for the most part at the <hi>Hague,</hi> which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend daily occasions, being rather imployed upon Affairs of <hi>State,</hi> than of particular Justice. The most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in this Counsel was <hi>Barnavil,</hi> by reason of his Advocates in <hi>Holland,</hi> and besides both these, every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and great Town have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40895:64"/> Counsels of their own, to all which Assemblies, as well of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral States, as the rest, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is called for order sake; But the State indeed is <hi>Democratical,</hi> the Merchant and the Tradesman being predominant, the Gentlemen now but few and poor, and even at the beginning the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> saw it safer to rely upon the Towns than them, Neither are the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try so much ingaged in the cause, the people having more advantage in a Free State, than in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
                  <p>Their care in Government is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exact and particular, by reason that every one hath an immediate interest in the State, such is the equality of Justice, that it renders every man satisfied, such the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Regularity, as a man may see their Laws were made to Guide, not to Entrap, such their Exactness in casting the expence of an Army, as that it shall be equally far from superfluity and want, and as much
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40895:64"/> order and certainty in their acts of War, as in ours of Peace, teaching it to be both Civil and Rich, and they still retain that sign of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth yet uncorrupted, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Poverty, and publick Wealth, for no one private man there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Rich, and few very Poor, and no State more sumptuous in all publick things.</p>
                  <p>But the question is, whether this being a Free State will as well sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in Peace, as it hath done hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in War, Peace leaving every one to attend his particular Wealth, when Fear while the War lasts, makes them concur for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon safety, and <hi>Zealand</hi> upon the least security, hath been ever envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at the predominancy of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Æ²trecht</hi> ready to mutiny for Religion; and besides, it is a doubt whether the same care and sincerity would continue if they were at their consistence, as appears yet whilst they are but in rising.</p>
                  <p>The Revenue of this State ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40895:65"/> chiefly from the Earl of <hi>Hollands</hi> Demesnes, the confiscated Church Livings, the rising and falling of money, which they use with much advantage, their Fishing upon our Coasts, and those of <hi>Norway,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution out of the enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, Taxes upon all things at home, and Imposition upon all Merchandizes ftom abroad; their expences upon their Ambassadors, their shipping, their ditches, their rampiers and munition, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they have in pay by Sea and Land 60000 men.</p>

                  <speaker>L. M.</speaker>
                  <p>If it be not too trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to you, a word or two of their Strength, Discipline &amp; War.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T. O.</speaker>
                  <p>For their Strength, the nature of the Countrey makes them able to defend themselves long by Land; neither could any thing have indangered them so much as the last great frost, had not the Treaty been then on foot, because the Enemy being then Master of the field, that renders their Ditches, Marshes, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40895:65"/> Rivers, as firm Ground, and by Sea they are able to offend any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>There belong to the State 2000 Vessels of all sorts, so that if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> were entirely beaten out of those parts, the King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> would take as much pains to suppress, as ever they did to raise them; for being our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they are able to give us the Law at <hi>Sea,</hi> and eat us out of all Trade, much more the <hi>French,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at this time three ships for our one, though none so good as our best.</p>
                  <p>Now that whereupon the most part of their Revenue and Strength depends is their Traffick, in which mistery of State they are at this day the wisest, for all the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which this part of the World wants and the <hi>Indies</hi> have, is Spice, Silk, Jewels, Gold, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Conveyors of them to the rest of Christendom except us; as the <hi>Venitians</hi> were of old, and all
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40895:66"/> those Commodities that these Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countreys abound with, and those Southern stand in need of, they likewise convey thither, which was the ancient Trade of the Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; And this they do, having little to export of their own, by buying of their Neighbour Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys the former, and selling them again what they bring back at their own prises, and so consequently live upon the idleness of others; And to this purpose their scituation serves fitly, for the River of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> the <hi>Maze,</hi> and <hi>Skeld</hi> end all in their Dominions, and the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Sea lyes not far from them, all which affords them whatever the great Continent of <hi>Germany, Russia</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> yields; then they again lying between <hi>Germany</hi> and the Sea, do furnish it back with all Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities foreign.</p>
                  <p>To remember some pieces of their Discipline, as patterns of the rest, The Watches at Night are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all of one Nation, so that they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40895:66"/> can hardly concur to give up any one Town.</p>
                  <p>The Commissaries are no where so strict upon Musters, and where he finds a company, thither he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth them, so that when an Army marcheth, the List and the Poll are never far disagreeing.</p>
                  <p>Their Army is ever well Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, well Armed, and had never yet occasion to mutiny for Pay or Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiers commit no where fewer Insolencies upon the Burgers, fewer Robberies upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, nor the Officers fewer Deceits upon the Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, they provide well that their General shall have small means to invade their Liberties; For first, their Army is composed of many Nations, which have their several Commanders, and the Commanders are disposed by the States them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, not by the General; And secondly, he hath never an implicite Commission left to Discretion, but
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40895:67"/> by reason their Countrey hath no great bounds, receives daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands what to do.</p>

                  <p>The Territory containes six entire Provinces, <hi>Holland, Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Æ²trecht, Groninghen, Over-Yssel,</hi> and <hi>Friezland,</hi> and certain Towns in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> the ground of which is for the most part fruitful, the Towns no where so equally Beautiful, Rich and Strong, which equality grows by reason that they appropriate some one Staple Commoditie to every Town of note; onely <hi>Amsterdam</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passeth them all, but even <hi>Sevil, Lisbon,</hi> or any other Mart Town in Christendome; and to it is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated the Trade of the <hi>East Indies,</hi> where they maintain commonly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ships, besides which, there go twice a year from it, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Towns, a great Fleet to the Baltique Sea; upon the fall of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerp</hi> that rose rather than <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>

                  <p>Concerning the People, they are neither much Devout, nor much Wicked, given all to Drink, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently to no other Vice; hard in bargaining, but just; surly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectless, as in all Democracies; thrifty, industrious, and cleanly, dishartened upon the least ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and insolent upon good; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive in manufactures, cunning in Traffick, and generally for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Action; that natural slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of theirs suits better by reason of the advisedness and perseverance it brings with it, than the rashness and changeableness of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Florentine</hi> Wits; and the equallity of spirits which is among them and the <hi>Switzers,</hi> renders them so fit for a Democracie, which kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Nations of more subtile Wits being once come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent greatness have seldome long endured.</p>

                  <p>It was like to be a breach, but in the year 1613. the States sent their Ambassadours with full power to offer any satisfaction, and when that succeeded not, in the year 1615. they offered more in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the <hi>Hague,</hi> touching the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> and at last in a third Treaty at <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1619. there was a full and solemn composition made of all the said differences, and a fair or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der set for the future proceeding in both Companies, as well in the course of their Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, as otherwise.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> and others encroaching upon the Fishers and other our Rights in the Narrow Seas, yea things coming to that pass by their observation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward humour of the <hi>English</hi> at home, that they disputed our Right by <hi>Grotius;</hi> his Sacred Majesty thought fit not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to employ Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> to <hi>cleare</hi> the Right; but the Earle of <hi>Lindsey</hi> as Admiral, and the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> as Vice-Admiral, with 40. Saile set out with the Shipmoney to secure it; whereby the <hi>English</hi> puissance was rendered so considerable, and trade so safe in the eyes of forreign Princes, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> thought it his safest course to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40895:79"/> his Bullion in our Bottoms, which was coined in <hi>England,</hi> to the great benefit of the Kings Mint, and of all the Merchants also, whose Commodities were exchanged thereby, and the rest of the money paid over by exchange to <hi>Flanders;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Hollander</hi> courted his Majesty with Presents, 1. of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergrease, 2. transparent China Basons, 3. a Clock, and 4. the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of <hi>Tintoret</hi> and <hi>Titian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the year 1636. the King considering the good effects of his late Fleet, sets out another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of 60. Saile of good Ships un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earle of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Command, who going Northwards scoured the Seas of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Busses, seizing some, sinking others, and enforcing the rest to fly; so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them all to a precarious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of entreating the favour of Fishing by the Kings Commission, which he was the readier to indulge them, because he looked upon them as the most likely instruments for his

                  <p>Our Historians say that our reputation was hereby greatly <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Baker</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> impaired for suffering the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to fall upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in our Seas; and they say likewise that they doubting that we might resent the affront done us in that action, were willing to keep us so busied that we should have no opportunity of retaliation and to that end they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated the <hi>Scots,</hi> they say, with all manner of warlike provisions.</p>
                  <p>But that excellent Prince, then whom many might make greater shewes, none had greater affections for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, minding as well the common interest of Protestants abroad as that more particular of <hi>Englishmen</hi> at home, made a strict alliance with that state by the Marriage of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40895:80"/> yet when our neighbour <hi>Dutch-men</hi> minded their interest, and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Masters at Sea in the Northern Fishing, which because so far, and of so small a return, they went away with the whole benefit; upon our Fishmongers complaint he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged several overtures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects concerning Busses for our own Coasts service, the prevention of strangers, and the improvement of the Narrow Seas, and withal he broke the confederacy that was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into between the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> before <hi>Dunkirke.</hi>

                  <p>They sent Embassadours to the Parliament to declare that the high and mighty States of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces had sent them to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate a reconciliation, that they might concurr together for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Popery, and the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Protestant Religion.</p>
                  <p>Here they remained (saith Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> how truly I know not,)
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40895:80"/> pretending a peace, but in earnest to settle trade, and see which way the game went, and as he adds, the King knew their minds; and then they urged very hard for the King, whom they had saved, had their Embassadour (as the same Author hath it) been as true to his trust as <hi>They</hi> were to the King.</p>
                  <p>After the Kings Death they broke with the <hi>English,</hi> and when <hi>Oliver St. John</hi> and <hi>Walter Strickland</hi> were sent into <hi>Holland</hi> they were affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ill used by the common people, and thereupon return in discontent: Hereupon forsooth a new Act is made for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Shipping</hi> and <hi>Navigation.</hi>
